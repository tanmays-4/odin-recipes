# Odin Recipes

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The goal is to build a simple recipe website using basic web development technologies. The website will showcase various recipes, with each recipe having its own page.

## Project Description

In this project, I will create a webpage where users can view and explore different recipes. The project will demonstrate how to use basic HTML for content structuring and CSS for styling.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **HTML**: Structuring a webpage with headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.
- **CSS**: Styling the page to enhance the layout, colors, and typography.
- **Git**: Using Git for version control, committing changes, and pushing to a remote repository.

## What I've Learned

Once this project is completed, I will have learned how to:
- Structure a basic website using HTML.
- Style a webpage using CSS.
- Use Git for version control and GitHub for hosting the project.
